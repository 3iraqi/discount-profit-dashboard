> ### Data Granularity

```plaintext

# Business Concept: Data Granularity Merging these tables creates a granular dataset—the most detailed level of information (the individual product line item within an order). High granularity allows for detailed analysis (e.g., which specific product is most profitable in which specific city), which is far more useful for making precise business decisions than aggregated data.
